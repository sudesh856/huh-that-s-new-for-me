#so learnt about this:
say this consisting file name is name.py 
and not having this is e.py
if __name__ == '__main__":
  main()

Basically what it does is that it helps to borrow the piece of code without needing to import full.

if we run the code directly from the file where there is this, then main() is run.
otherwise if we import name.py as "import name" 
in the next file "e.py"
then the __name__ == '__main__':
    main() WON'T RUN AS THIS IS NOT BEING RUN DIRECTLY.

suppose in e.py there is:
import name
name.fav_food("pizza") then only this is run not the main() one.


NOTE:
LET THE SAMPLE CODE IN name.py be: 
def fav_food(food):
    print(f"your fav food is {food}")


def main():
    print("this is app.py")
    fav_food("chicken")
   
    print("goodbye")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


AND IN e.py be:
import app
app.fav_food("chicken")
